# WMP Video Player

#### Special thanks to Matt West's [tutorial](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/building-custom-controls-for-html5-videos) 

This project aims to 'concatenate' video files segments on the fly for the use of the Wesleyan Media Project

This sample 'shows' a video player that actually contains three chunked video files in the backend. The player aims for seamless transition between the videos and offers a controller that factors in the total running time of all three files.

This implementation used Matt West's tutorial as a backbone for the custom controller.
